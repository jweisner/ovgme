OvGME is a game mod manager based on the idea and concept of JSGME, it take the GME acronym
from JSGME which stands for Generic Mod Enabler. The main purpose of OvGME is to provide an
easy way to import and enable mods for games then restore original files when disabling mods.

what files to replace, create and save as backup.
